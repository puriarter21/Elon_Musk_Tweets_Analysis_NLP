just as with alcohol prohibition, people didn’t actually stop drinking, but they did start drinking badly made alcohol (moonshine), which could be poisonous, depending on how it was made and what contaminants were present. 

the strength of fentanyl means that even a small dosage increase can be fatal. people are rarely trying to commit suicide, but they can easily inadvertently take too much. therefore, it seems likely to me that pharma-grade quality and precise dosage will dramatically reduce deaths.
